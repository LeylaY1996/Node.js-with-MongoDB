What is Node.js?


Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows back-end developers to use JavaScript to create server-side applications and APIs.





What is Node.js Used For?


Using Node.js allows your front-end (i.e. React, Vue.js, even jQuery) developers to use the same programming language, JavaScript, as your backend developers. This allows for more cross-functional and agile development. Node.js usage is widespread and ongoing, and I highly recommend it for new development.


How to Create a MongoDB Database Using Node.js


When creating a database, you can choose to set it up locally or in the cloud. For example, you can spin up an installation on localhost manually of MongoDB by downloading and installing MongoDB. That said, a manual installation comes with ongoing maintenance and upkeep costs. As an application developer, I prefer to avoid as much manual work as possible, so I tend to shy away from manual installation.

For cloud offerings, there is MongoDB Atlas, the database-as-a-service offering from MongoDB. It is platform-agnostic, allowing you to create database clusters on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and scaling is as simple as clicking a button. They also made it easy to get started, with a free M0 tier. The total time from signup to having a created database was less than five minutes for me.
